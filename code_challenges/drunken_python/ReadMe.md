Drunken Python
Python got drunk and the built-in functions str() and int() are acting odd:

str(4) ➞ 4

str("4") ➞ 4

int("4") ➞ "4"

int(4) ➞ "4"
You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int(). A function called int_to_str() that converts integers into strings and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings into integers.

Examples:
int_to_str(4) ➞ "4"

str_to_int("4") ➞ 4

int_to_str(29348) ➞ "29348"
Notes
This is meant to illustrate the dangers of using already-existing function names.
Extra points if you can de-drunk Python.
